    "Content-Based Filtering: This approach recommends items based on their inherent characteristics and features. It analyzes the properties of items, such as genre, actors, or keywords, and recommends similar items to users based on their preferences for those features. For example, if a user enjoys action movies, a content-based recommender would suggest other action movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering: Collaborative filtering recommends items based on the preferences and behavior of similar users. It finds patterns and similarities among users' ratings or interactions with items and suggests items that are liked by users with similar tastes. Collaborative filtering can be further divided into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. User-Based Collaborative Filtering: This method identifies users with similar preferences and recommends items liked by those similar users. For example, if User A and User B have similar movie preferences and User A liked a particular movie, the system would recommend that movie to User B.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: This method identifies items that are similar based on user ratings and recommends items that are similar to those the user has already rated positively. For example, if a user liked Movie X, the system would recommend movies similar to Movie X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid Recommender Systems: These systems combine multiple recommendation approaches to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations. They leverage the strengths of different models to overcome limitations and improve the quality of recommendations. For instance, a hybrid recommender system might use collaborative filtering to capture user preferences and content-based filtering to enhance the recommendations based on item features.\n",

    "Knowledge-Based Recommender Systems: These systems make recommendations by using explicit knowledge about the user's preferences and needs. They typically employ rule-based or knowledge-based techniques to infer user preferences from their stated requirements or explicit feedback. For example, a knowledge-based recommender might ask the user a series of questions to understand their specific needs and then provide tailored recommendations based on that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning-Based Recommender Systems: These systems utilize reinforcement learning techniques to learn and adapt the recommendations based on user feedback and interactions.

    "**Q5**. In order to fit a [LightFM](https://lyst.github.io/lightfm/docs/home.html) model, we need to transform our Dataframe to a sparse matrix (cf. below). This is not straightforward so we included the function `df_to_matrix` in `utils.py`.\n",

    "> 🔦 **Hint**:  Sparse matrices are just **big matrices with a lot of zeros or empty values**.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Existing tools (Pandas DataFrame, Numpy arrays for example) are not suitable for manipulating this kind of data. So we will use [Scipy sparse matrices](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/sparse.html).\n",

    "> 🔦 **Hint 2**:  By going from a DataFrame to a sparse matrix, you will lose the information of the ids (userId and movieId), you will only deal with indices (row number and column number). Therefore, the `df_to_matrix` function also returns dictionaries mapping indexes to ids (ex: uid_to_idx mapping userId to index of the matrix) \n",
